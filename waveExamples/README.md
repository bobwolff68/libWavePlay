## WAVE EXAMPLES

All files were downloaded from freesound.org under Creative Commons license for non-commercial use.

Original files were stereo and 44.1kHz or 48kHz. For a simple micro like the ESP32, it often makes
sense to use 8kHz and mono, so the files in this folder are. The OrigFrequency/ folder files are
also mono instead of stereo, but they are at their original fidelity/frequency.
